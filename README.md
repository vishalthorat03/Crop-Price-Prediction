This project focuses on predicting crop prices using a regression model based on agricultural data. The dataset includes various features related to crop cultivation, environmental factors, and associated costs. The goal is to accurately predict the price of different crops using these features.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following columns:

State: The state in which the crop is grown.
Crop: The type of crop (e.g., ARHAR, COTTON).
CostCultivation: The cost of cultivation (in one phase).
CostCultivation2: The cost of cultivation (in another phase).
Production: The production quantity of the crop.
Yield: The yield of the crop.
Temperature: The average temperature in the region.
RainFall Annual: The annual rainfall in the region.
Price: The market price of the crop.

Model Selection
Several regression algorithms were considered for predicting crop prices:

Linear Regression: A basic linear approach to modeling the relationship between the features and crop prices.
Random Forest Regressor: A tree-based ensemble method that captures non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
Gradient Boosting Regressor: An advanced boosting algorithm that builds an ensemble of trees to minimize prediction errors.
XGBoost: A more advanced and efficient implementation of gradient boosting.

Model Evaluation
The performance of the models was evaluated using the following metrics:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions. In this project, the RMSE was found to be 7965.79.
R² (Coefficient of Determination): Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model. An R² score of 0.945 was achieved, indicating that the model explains 94.5% of the variance in crop prices.
Visualization
To better understand the model's performance, several visualizations were created:

Actual vs. Predicted Prices: A scatter plot to compare the predicted prices with the actual prices.
Residual Plot: Shows the residuals (errors) to detect patterns or trends.
Histogram of Residuals: Displays the distribution of residuals to check for normality.
Q-Q Plot of Residuals: Assesses if the residuals follow a normal distribution.
Feature Importance: For tree-based models, this plot shows which features contribute most to the predictions.
Learning Curves: These plots help diagnose overfitting or underfitting by comparing model performance on training and validation sets.
Conclusion
The model achieved a high R² score, indicating strong predictive performance. The RMSE value should be interpreted relative to the price range in the dataset. Various visualizations were used to ensure that the model is appropriate and to understand the influence of different features on crop prices.

Future Work
Potential improvements and next steps include:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Further fine-tuning of the model parameters to improve performance.
Exploring Additional Features: Including more relevant features to potentially increase the model's predictive power.
Cross-Validation: Implementing cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
